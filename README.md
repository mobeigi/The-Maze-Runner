The Maze Runner
=========
The Maze Runner was a COMP2911-Project which was completed in May 2014. This java game involves solving a maze while collecting coins and avoiding enemy monsters. Players can progress through levels of increasingly difficulty upto level 10.

Levels are completed by picking up a golden key and unlocking a wooden door which appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.
There are also powerups such a 'sword' which can be used to kill enemies and 'freeze' which freezes all enemy movement. Enemies move towards the player each second and the number of enemies increase each level.
Players can also press a hint button to be presented with a path that guides them towards the wooden door.
